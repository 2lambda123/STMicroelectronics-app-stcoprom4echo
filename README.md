# STCoproM4Echo #

This application is a basic example of the proprietary CoproService usage on the STM32MPU reference devices.
It's associated to the [STM32MPU Embedded Software distribution for Android](https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Category:STM32MPU_Embedded_Software_distribution_for_Android).

The co-processor firmware used is available by default in the distribution.
The principle is just to send characters to the co-processor firmware through the CoproService and receive an echo of these characters.
